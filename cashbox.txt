Cashbox - Personal finance tracker

Version 1.0

Created by John Ellis

========
OVERVIEW
========

Cashbox is a simple yet powerful Python based finance management tool, designed to help users track monthly direct debit payment, savings and investments.

It provides features for managing multiple savings accounts, and multiple investment portfolios, calculating growth projections for a 10 year period and logging contributions. All data is stored locally in SQLite databases.

========
FEATURES
========

* Monthly Direct Debit Tracking - add your direct debits for the month - view them in a list - as direct debits go out add them and compare at the end of the month, this helps me see any unexpected bills that might have gone up or down.

* Savings Tracker - Add and manage multiple savings accounts with balances and interest rates

* Investment Tracker - Monitor investment portfolios and project growth under various market conditions

* Automatic Projection - Generate 1-10 year estimated growth for both savings and investments

* Contribution Logging - Record and view past deposits and investment additions

* Local Database Storage - All data is stored securely using SQLite (no external dependencies

===========
INSTALLATION
===========

* Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed
* Create a new folder for cashbox and save the .py file inside, this will hold the SQLite databases as well

* (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
SQLite is built into python so no external database setup is required.

==========
HOW TO USE
==========

Run the main program from terminal:

python3 cashbox.py

Follow the on screen menu options to:

* Check and track monthly direct debits
* Add new savings or investment accounts
* View balances and projections
* Record monthly contributions
* Exit safely - all data is automatically stored

=========
DATABASES
=========

Each database is created automatically the first time you run cashbox.

============
FUTURE PLANS
============

* GUI version (Tkinter based)
* Graphical analytics dashboard
* Export reports to csv / MS Excel or Libre Office Calc
* Multi currency support

NOTES FROM THE DEVELOPER
========================

Cashbox started out as a program I developed to demonstrate the skills I had learned after working through the books Python: a crash course and Python: automating the boring stuff as I found the practice programs in the books not very interesting or relevant, I wanted to build programs I can use everyday.

I wanted to create a program that took all the spreadsheets I used on a daily basis for tracking my finances and have everything in one single program.

I am happy with it for now but I know there is so much potential for this program. Even to add modules to keep a track on debts.

I am currently working through a new book learning Tkinter and GUI development, which I will use to develop the new version of cashbox and other programs I have developed or still working on.

Thank you for using cashbox, I hope you find it useful.
